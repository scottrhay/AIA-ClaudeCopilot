description: Explain code simply for junior developers
---

Explain $ARGUMENTS as if teaching a junior developer on their first day.

## Guidelines

- **Use analogies:** Compare code concepts to real-world things (restaurants, libraries, post offices, etc.)
- **Avoid jargon:** If you must use a technical term, define it immediately
- **Break it down:** Number the steps, don't throw everything at once
- **Explain WHY:** Don't just say what happens - explain why it's done this way
- **Be encouraging:** Use phrases like "this is a common pattern" not "obviously..."

## Format

1. **Start with a one-sentence summary** - What is this code's job?

2. **The Analogy** - Compare it to something familiar

3. **Step by Step** - Walk through what happens
   - Step 1: ...
   - Step 2: ...

4. **Why This Way?** - Explain the design choice

5. **💡 Key Takeaway:** One sentence to remember
