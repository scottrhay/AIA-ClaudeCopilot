## Real Examples by Letter

### G — Goal
- "Summarize this quarterly report **for the board of directors**"
- "Draft a follow-up email **to close the deal with Acme Corp**"
- "Create interview questions **to assess leadership skills for a VP role**"

### O — Output
- "Format as a **one-page executive summary with bullet points**"
- "Create a **comparison table** with pros, cons, and recommendation"
- "Write as a **professional email** with subject line and signature"

### L — Length
- "**500 words max** — this goes in a newsletter"
- "**3-5 bullet points** per section, no paragraphs"
- "**One page** when printed — dense but scannable"

### D — Details
- "Our fiscal year runs **April to March**. Compare Q3 to Q3, not calendar quarters"
- "The audience is **non-technical executives** who don't know AI terminology"
- "Include **specific dollar amounts and percentages** from the attached data"

### E — Examples
- "Match the **tone of last quarter's report** (attached)"
- "Structure like: **Finding → Impact → Recommendation** for each point"
- "Here's an example of what I want: **'Revenue grew 12% YoY driven by Enterprise segment'**"

### N — No-gos
- "**No jargon** — write for a general business audience"
- "**Don't include** competitor names, only refer to them as 'Competitor A, B, C'"
- "**Avoid** passive voice and corporate buzzwords like 'synergy' or 'leverage'"

## Before & After

### ❌ Before (Vague)

### ✅ After (GOLDEN)
> **G:** Summarize Q4 results for the board  
> **O:** Executive summary with bullet points  
> **L:** One page maximum (500 words)  
> **D:** Revenue $4.2M, margin 34%, YoY growth 18%. Highlight Enterprise segment (+22%) and flag SMB decline (-5%)  
> **E:** Structure each finding as: Metric → Trend → Implication  
> **N:** No raw data tables, no jargon, no appendix

**Result:** Claude delivers exactly what you need on the first try.

## Quick Rules

- **Simple task?** G + O is enough ("Summarize this email in 3 bullets")
- **Important task?** Use all 6 letters
- **Not getting what you want?** Add more D (Details) and E (Examples)
- **Too long/short?** Specify L (Length) explicitly
- **Wrong tone or content?** Add N (No-gos)
