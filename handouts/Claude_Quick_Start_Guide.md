Write 2-3 sentences about yourself. This applies to ALL conversations.

**Template:**
> I am a [your role] at [company type] in [industry]. My expertise: [areas]. Communication preferences: [concise/detailed], [formal/casual], [beginner/expert] level.

**Example:**
> I am a Finance Manager at a mid-size healthcare company. My expertise: budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis. Preferences: concise responses with specific numbers, professional tone, intermediate technical level. Our fiscal year runs April-March.

**Time saved:** ~5 min/day on repeating context.

## When to Use Which Model

| Model | Use When | Speed | Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| **Haiku** | Quick lookups, simple formatting | ⚡ Fastest | $ |
| **Sonnet** | 90% of work (default) | ⚡⚡ Fast | $$ |
| **Opus** | High-stakes, complex analysis | 🐢 Slower | $$$ |

**Rule of thumb:** Start with Sonnet. Switch to Opus only when stakes are high.
