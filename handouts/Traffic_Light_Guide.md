## 🔴 Red Light — Human Owns It

*High stakes, specialized knowledge, or irreversible consequences. AI assists, you decide.*

| Task | Why It's Red |
|------|-------------|

| Medical or health recommendations | Liability and safety risk |
| Final financial decisions (investments, loans) | Fiduciary responsibility |
| Handling personal/sensitive data (SSN, salary) | Privacy and compliance risk |
| Official company statements (press, legal) | Reputational and legal exposure |
| Regulatory compliance determinations | Requires certified expertise |
| Hiring/firing decisions | Legal liability, human judgment |
| Security architecture decisions | Risk of breach if wrong |
| Mergers, acquisitions, strategic commitments | Irreversible, high-stakes |
| Anything requiring professional certification | AI has no license or liability |

**Red rule:** If getting it wrong has legal, financial, or safety consequences → human decides, AI assists.

## Decision Framework

```
Is the task low-stakes and easy to verify?
  → YES → 🟢 Green: Trust it
  → NO  → Could you verify the key facts?
             → YES → 🟡 Yellow: Use it, then check
             → NO  → 🔴 Red: Human decides, AI assists
```

**When in doubt, treat it as Yellow.** Verify key points, then proceed.

## The 19% Rule

A BCG study found teams **lost 19% accuracy** when they used AI on tasks outside its capability frontier (Red Light tasks treated as Green). Knowing which color your task is prevents this drop.

**The skill isn't using AI — it's knowing WHEN to use AI.**
